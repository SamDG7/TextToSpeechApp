## About The Project
Developed a cutting-edge Text-to-Speech web application using Angular, AWS Polly, Lambda, and S3. Leveraged AWS Polly's AI-driven voice synthesis to transform user-provided text into natural-sounding spoken words. Implemented a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda for efficient and scalable processing, while storing and retrieving audio files securely in AWS S3. The application offers an intuitive user interface, allowing users to input text, select preferred voices, and instantly generate spoken content. This project showcases proficiency in AWS cloud services, serverless computing, and modern web development.
